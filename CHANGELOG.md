## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- **Style switcher** — header-bar dropdown applies a full citation style to the active document; styles: SBL, Chicago (Notes-Bib), Chicago (Author-Date), MLA, APA 7th, ASA, Turabian, Harvard; updates or appends `#bibliography(...)` at the end of the document with the correct style key and section title ("Works Cited" for MLA, "Reference List" for Chicago Author-Date)
- **New from Template dialog** — five-tab dialog (Document, Layout, Sections, Languages, Packages) generates a complete Typst preamble; citation styles, paper sizes, margin presets, font selection, line spacing, page numbers, ToC/Abstract/Keywords toggles, language support (Russian, Hebrew, Greek, Japanese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese), extra packages (Droplet, Codly, Showybox, Gentle Clues, Tablex, Drafting)
- **Todo panel** — split pane with Global and per-file todo lists; checkbox rows; Enter adds item; checked items move to a Completed section with strikethrough; persisted as `- [ ] / - [x]` markdown files
- **Session restore** — open files, active tab, and cursor positions saved to `~/.local/share/zerkalo/session.json` and restored on next launch
- **Configurable keybindings** — `~/.config/zerkalo/keybindings.toml` written on first launch with defaults; parsed at runtime so edits take effect on next start
- **LaTeX import** — ☰ → Import LaTeX File; converts `.tex` to Typst via `pandoc -f latex -t typst` and opens the result in a new tab
- **Export ODT and LaTeX** — two new formats added to the Export dialog (pandoc)
- **Inline LSP diagnostics** — compile errors and LSP warnings rendered as red/amber underlines in the editor using GtkSourceView TextTags
- **Built-in academic snippets** — figure, table, footnote, bibliography, pagebreak, outline, lorem, set rule, show rule, block; prepended to the LSP completion popup with `#`-prefix matching
- **Font management** — ☰ → Font Management; searchable checkbox list of all fc-list fonts; Enable All / Disable All; persisted to `~/.config/zerkalo/font-preferences.toml`
- **GOST Type B font** — bundled in `assets/fonts/` and installed to the user font directory on first launch
- **Welcome window** — version-keyed "What's New" dialog shown on first launch of each new version; scrollable; includes Quick Start and keyboard shortcuts
- **Cursor-tracking outline** — outline panel highlights the heading the cursor is currently under as you type
- **Whole-word find** — "W" toggle button in the Find bar; checks word boundaries before and after each match
- **LSP diagnostic deduplication** — when tinymist sends diagnostics, compile-stderr errors are suppressed to avoid duplicates
- **Outline click navigation** — single click on an outline row centres and selects the heading line in the editor
- **Auto-compile on file open** — switching to a tab immediately triggers a compile (no manual Preview click needed)
- **Simple mode sidebar toggle** — switch at the bottom of the sidebar
- **System accent colours** — outline hover and selected rows use `@accent_color` / `@accent_bg_color` from the Adwaita theme

### Changed
- Debounce reduced from 500 ms to 300 ms
- Preview button labelled "Preview" (was an icon-only button)
- Segmented Outline|Symbols control moved inside the outline panel
- Version bumped to 0.2.0

### Removed
- DOI/ISBN import (Zotero does not sync `.bib` additions made by external tools)

### Fixed
- Style switcher crash: `apply_style()` held a `state.borrow()` across `buffer.set_text()`, which fired `connect_changed` → `borrow_mut()` → RefCell panic; fixed by cloning the buffer before releasing the borrow
- Outline click did nothing: `row.connect_activate` only fires on Enter/double-click; replaced with `list_box.connect_row_activated` which fires on single click
- `scroll_to_iter` centering: `use_align` was `false`, causing the `yalign: 0.5` argument to be ignored; corrected to `true`
